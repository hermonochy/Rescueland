**Dimensions:** 15-10-6 Metres

**Speed:** 0.7 Googolplex c

**Range:** 213 septillion ly

**Ship Type:** DarkFighter Interceptor

**Dimensions:** 7-7-5 Metres

**Speed:** 45 c

**Range:** Near Infinite

**General:** This is the main design for Helucky’s DarkFighters. However, it lacks effectiveness due to the installation of an undersized cannon, rendering it nearly harmless.

*Disclaimer: Although it may resemble a TIE fighter, this design is fundamentally different. The 'wings' are shields, not solar panels and it is a drone, not piloted.*
