**Dimensions:** 20-5-5

**Ship Type:** Common Solita Interceptor

**Dimensions:** 15-10-6 Metres

**Speed:** 0.7 Googolplex c

**Range:** 213 septillion ly

**General:** Based on the Rescueland [Lightfighter](#the-rescueland-lightfighter), this interceptor was designed to create confusion regarding the actual number of lightfighters. Its enhanced durability has earned it the nickname "Lightfighterlings." Unlike the Plamea Interceptor, this model is tailored specifically for combat roles.

**Ship Type:** DarkFighter Interceptor

**Dimensions:** 7-7-5 Metres

**Speed:** 45 c

**Range:** Near Infinite

**General:** This is the main design for Heluckyâ€™s DarkFighters. However, it lacks effectiveness due to the installation of an undersized cannon, rendering it nearly harmless.

*Disclaimer: Although it may resemble a TIE fighter, this design is fundamentally different. The 'wings' are shields, not solar panels and it is a drone, not piloted.*
### The Helucky DarkFighter Frigade
