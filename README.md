# Recua and Computerland

Recua, aka Rescueland, is part of the multiverse, as few people know it. Its location cannot be fathomed by common earthlings, as it is located beyond the borders of the known universe, from which conventional technology on planet Earth only senses the background radiation.
The name 'Rescueland' formed in the process of Recua 'rescuing' civilisations against a phletora of hostile invaders dotted around the multiverses. The name has stuck ever since. 
To give an illustration of space scale: If the earth-known universe corresponds to the content of a tea cup, the earth would be a single electron, and Rescueland corresponds to the cup containing our known world. Rescueland existed since when the cup was filled, i.e., the event commonly known as the Big Bang.

Rescueland existance began 5,630,630 r.ly (Rescueland years) BDOTR (Before the Discovery of the Rings), which is exactly when the Big Bang happened, and has evolved for 500,000 earth years anno domini, coming up with technology nobody on earth in 2024 AD would remotely think of being possible. 

Computerland, in the analogon of the tea cup model, is another cup planet, allied to Rescueland, so far away that even the longest-range ships find it impractical to travel between them regularly. In this scale, imagine the distance between the Computerland and Rescueland cups corresponding to the distance between Spain and New Caledonia.


## Fact Files

These are the notes and data about Rescueland and Computerland, including the technology, the history, the planets and the types of ships used.
Facts and concepts are interdependent to a very high degree. Hence, for a complete understanding, it is likely required to double parse these documents.

[The Technology of Rescueland, Computerland and it's surrounding Planets](./The%20Technology%20of%20Rescueland%2C%20Computerland%20and%20it's%20surrounding%20Planets.md)
is far superior to the technology on planet earth in the 21st century.
Through millenia of basic research, it became possible to control all aspects of matter on every scale, resulting in interesting quecto-materials aggregated into macroscopic hyperstructures. 
A detailed reference of all technological minutiae is beyond the scope of this script, as no single person or Non-Rescueland robot has sufficient mental capacity or storage to retain it. A coarse overview is sufficiently taxing.

[The Planet File](./The%20Planet%20File.md)
holds key data on all major civilizations in and around the Rescueland Empire, notably population, atmospheric conditions, emblems, geography, military capabilities, political systems, multiversal status and general information, arranged by distance to Rescueland. The planet file also introduces the multiversal factions.

[The Ship File](./The%20Ship%20File.md)
provides insights into the design fundamentals of all major spacecraft utilized by planets with a technology level exceeding 10.

[The Timeline of Rescueland History](./The%20Timeline%20of%20Resueland%20History.md)
reaches back to the Big Bang, including the major events DOTR, the start of the space-age, beginning of intra-multiversal travel, discovery of new planets, introduction of the Super Twos and the succession of major multiversal conflicts.
[The Timeline of Computerland History](./The%20Timeline%20of%20Computerland%20History.md) 
shows these events from the view of Computerland.

## Short Stories

For being able to follow the short stories linked in this paragraph, it is essential to be intimately familiar with the Timeline of Rescueland History (see above).

- [The Beginning of The War for Rescueland](./Short_Stories/The%20Beginning%20of%20The%20War%20for%20Rescueland.md) recounts the start of the first major war that took place on Rescueland, from the perspective of the first FRJ having noticed the military events that would lead to the conquering of Rescueland.
