[Computerland](./The%20Planet%20File.md#computerland-i) is an extraordinary planet composed of a [Conductium](./The%20Technology%20of%20Rescueland%2C%20Computerland%20and%20it's%20surrounding%20Planets.md#conductium-c-con-duct-ee-umm) core and sentient electricity, characterized by its unique technological advancement and cooperative relations with the [Rescueland Empire](./The%20Planet%20File.md#rescueland-empire). However, it's history is relatively uneventful compared to that of [Rescueland](./The%20Timeline%20of%20Resueland%20History.md). This timeline highlights the significant events that shaped Computerland since its establishment and its evolution as a close ally of Rescueland.

## 5630630 BDOTR: The Creation of Computerland

Computerland formed around the same time as Rescueland, and this alignment is no coincidence. The phenomenon of sentient electricity and the unique environment of Computerland could only manifest under specific conditions present at that moment in the universe's history. Initially, the electricity that filled the planet did not possess sentience; however, the exact reason for its subsequent awakening remains shrouded in mystery. Remarkably, the electricity began to learn and evolve, exhibiting behavioral patterns akin to biological life forms but without the limitations imposed by mortality.

## 3653454 BTOTR: The Evolution of Sentience

During this era, the sentient electricity of Computerland successfully gained full self-awareness. The once-hive-minded electricity experienced a transformative divide, resulting in the emergence of individual consciousness. Although capable of existing as separate beings, these individuals retained the ability to connect back to the hive mind, allowing them to donate knowledge, communicate, and learn from one another while still maintaining their unique identities.

## 2950670 BROTR: The Understanding of Science

At this time the beings of Computerland learnt the nature of the universe. They began to decipher the fundamental principles of nature, drastically increasing their capacity for scientific discovery. Armed with this newfound understanding, they unlocked countless innovations and established a foundation for more profound explorations of existence.

## 0134233 BDOTR: Discovery of the Multiverse

Through an extensive scientific expedition to the boundaries of their universe, the beings of Computerland endeavored to measure high-speed collisions occurring near the threshold of existence. Their relentless pursuit of knowledge culminated in a breakthrough: a solitary particle beyond their universe, confirming the existence of other multiverses. While their current technology did not permit them to breach the barrier separating these realities, they knew that their time would come.

## 14 ADOTR: Discovery of Rescueland

In an important moment for intergalactic relationships, Computerland discovered Rescueland during its early space explorations. The people of Computerland learned about Rescueland’s fight against the tyrants of [Bad Guy Land](./The%20Planet%20File.md#bad-guy-land-previously-b)) and recognized their shared objective of resisting oppression. This key first contact set the stage for a strong alliance, uniting them to pool their strengths and collaborate cohesively against their mutual adversary.

## 15 ADOTR: The breach of the universal border

After the successful alliance with Rescueland, they managed to learn and borrow some tech from them to travel between universes. With this new technology, Computerland fully comprehended the extent of the danger posed by Bad Guy Land, which they had hitherto only glimpsed through the occasional scout ship.
