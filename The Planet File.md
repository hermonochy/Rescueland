# Core Systems

## The Rescueland System

### Rescueland (R)

**Name:** Rescueland/Recua

**Flag:** ![](images/Rescueland_flag.png)

**Pronounced:** resc-ooh-laned/r(with tongue roll)-ekk-ooh-ah

**Capital:** Non-existent

**Leader:** none (However, during war, Commander of War Weda has command of the armies.)

**Power Status:** 5999999997/6000000000

Army Size:
- **Interceptors:** 369 trillion
- **Battle Ships:** 834,000
- **Darkfighters:** 8
- **Ground Force:** 423 septillion

**Tech Level:** 12

**Population:** 8.9798*10^18

**Atmosphere:** Nitrogen 90%, Hydrogen 8%, Oxygen 1%

**General:** Rescueland stands out as the first of the three prominent 'superpowers', alongside Helucky and Recola. What makes Rescueland particularly unique is its focus on the quality and training of its military forces, setting it apart even though it possesses the smallest army among the three superpowers. 
The sheer effectiveness and elite training of Rescueland's troops allow them to compete on equal footing with larger forces. Their emphasis on teamwork and cohesion often leads to a highly disciplined fighting force capable of executing complex maneuvers under pressure.
Geographically, Rescueland is an extraordinary planet, sometimes enveloped by the largest [FFG](./The%20Technology%20of%20Rescueland%2C%20Computerland%20and%20it's%20surrounding%20Planets.md#force-field-gel-r) known in history. In the event of an invasion attempt, the invaders must strategically group and position themselves directly in front of the FFG, waiting for the shield to expire. Invaders must carefully plan their assault, as any miscalculation could result in disastrous consequences.
Rescueland's infrastructure and alliances also play a significant role in its defense strategy. While they may not have the sheer number of troops that Helucky or Recola boast, their innovative use of technology, along with diplomatic relationships developed over the years, provides them with additional layers of security. For the few organic beings living on Rescueland, the local cuisine includes a variety of plant-based dishes, using both native and imported ingredients. While not a dominant religion, some express devotion to the [Super Owls](./The%20Timeline%20of%20Resueland%20History.md#0-adotr-discovery-of-the-rings), holding ceremonies to invoke their blessings for protection and guidance by these seemingly supernatural beings. [Rescueland robots](./The%20Technology%20of%20Rescueland%2C%20Computerland%20and%20it's%20surrounding%20Planets.md#rescueland-robots-r) coexist in a vibrant society where FCRT children go to school, live in houses, and experience a lifecycle reminiscent of living organisms due to the effects of Rescueland Gas. This integration creates a unique blend of culture and community, leading to educational systems and social structures akin to those of organic life.

#### Oxo (R)

**Name:** Oxo

**Flag:**![](images/Oxo_flag.png)

While Oxo does not experience the extreme temperatures of its parent planet, it has its own set of environmental challenges that its inhabitants have learned to navigate.

## Helucky System

### Helucky (B)

**Name:** Helucky

**Flag:** ![](images/Helucky_flag.png)

**Pronounced:** He-luck-ee

**Capital:** Enah

**Leader:** The Great Computer

**Power Status:** 5999999999/6000000000

Army Size:
- **Interceptors:** 764 octillion
- **Battle Ships:** 121,000
- **Darkfighters:** 5
- **Ground Force:** 37 septillion

**Tech Level:** 11

**Population:** 766 octillion

**Atmosphere:** Oxygen 55%, Nitrogen 30%, Trace gases 15%

**General:** Helucky is the most powerful superpower, renowned for its sheer quantity of military resources and strategic capabilities. Its vast landscape is dotted with enormous military installations, factories and spaceports, all dedicated to producing one of the largest spaceborne interceptor armies known in the galaxy.
The planet’s military doctrine revolves around overwhelming force and relentless waves of interceptors, enabling Helucky to effectively defend itself and project power across its sphere of influence. The sheer size of its interceptor army instills a sense of intimidation among rival powers; Helucky could potentially take on not just one, but both superpowers simultaneously. However, despite this advantage in numbers, Helucky faces significant strategic limitations.
The primary obstacle hindering Helucky from launching an outright offensive is its insufficient fleet of battleships. Whereas interceptor crafts excel in air-to-air combat and rapid response, battleships are essential for commanding and controlling operations in vast sectors of space and for engaging formidable opponents effectively. The absence of a robust battleship fleet means that Helucky’s interceptors would be vulnerable when faced with sustained attacks. This vulnerability keeps Helucky leaders cautious, as an attack could leave them exposed to counterattacks and retaliatory strikes.
Moreover, the planet’s leaders are acutely aware of the risks associated with instigating an attack, given the fearsome reputation of Rescueland’s numerous [darkfighters](./The%20Ship%20File.md#dark-grey-and-light-fighters).
