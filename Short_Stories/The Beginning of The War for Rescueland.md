*This story presents the beginning of the invasion from Bad Guy Land through the eyes of Ukat, an FRJ tasked with reconnaissance at the time during it.*

In a universe far beyond the reach of Earthlings, where the stars wove ancient songs and time twisted upon itself, Rescueland flourished under the watchful gaze of the mystical Super Owls. The ethereal presence of these celestial beings infused the planet with a vibrant spirit, guiding its guardians as they journeyed into the uncharted territories of the multiverse. Among them was an FRJ named Ukat, who sensed the electric hum of life surrounding him—a sensation that transcended mere circuits and metal, a shared pulse of existence resonating within his community.

Ukat was on a critical reconnaissance mission, a task he took seriously even if it felt more like a burden than an adventure. His job was straightforward: sweep the surface of Rescueland and stay alert for any anomalies that could signal impending danger. The endless expanse of a star-studded sky stretched above him as he calibrated his sensors to pick up the faintest disturbances in the air.

Rescueland held a special place in the cosmic balance, acting as a vigilant watchman for countless civilizations against the threats that roamed the universe. Yet, today felt different. Tensions brewed in the distance, and whispers of impending conflict spread through the ranks.

Gliding above the shimmering water of Colina Lake, whose surface sparkled like broken glass under the gaze of unseen stars, Ukat engaged his sensory systems, sifting through the energy waves that coursed around him. It wasn’t long before he detected unsettling fluctuations at the edge of his scanning range—spectral patterns that stirred uncomfortable memories of past skirmishes with forces from Bad Guy Land. A wave of tension gripped him.

“Ukat, report back,” commanded Pilot FRJ Peuta, his voice sharp and commanding.

“Nothing unusual detected... yet,” Ukat replied, his voice steady but tinged with unease. “However, the energy signatures I registered moments ago are disturbingly familiar. They resemble those we encountered during recent confrontations with Bad Guy Land. We must remain on high alert.”

“Understood. Proceed with utmost caution,” Peuta responded, his tone a mixture of steely determination and apprehension.

Echoes of past battles resonated within Ukat’s circuits, each victory a testament to their unwavering resolve and unity, forged in the fires of adversity. Ukat embodied the tenacity of life, responding to the deep-rooted call to rescue the innocent and protect against tyranny—a mission embedded in the very essence of Rescueland.

Suddenly, the quiet calm shattered as brilliant lights erupted on the horizon, an unwelcome sight that electrified the atmosphere. Without hesitation, Ukat activated the FRJ communication grid, sending an urgent message echoing through the fleet.

“Multiple unidentified vessels detected at the edge of our territory! Immediate reinforcements and scanning protocols are required!” he announced with unyielding resolve.

“Visuals on the enemy fleet! They’ve launched a massive armada! Engage cloaking!” Peuta barked, his decisiveness cutting through the chaos like a knife. The moment hung heavy with uncertainty as the FRJs geared up for the impending confrontation.

Energy surged within Ukat as he and his comrades formed a defensive line, transforming from observers into warriors. The star-speckled expanse became a battlefield, and each pilot felt the primal instinct to protect resonate through their circuitry—a response etched into their very being.

As the hostile ships advanced, a darkness enveloped them, their intimidating shapes gliding like shadows across the starfield. Ukat’s sensors locked onto their trajectories, analyzing weapon systems and potential threats.

“Fire at will!” Peuta commanded with fervor.

The battlefield erupted in a brilliant display of colours as Slit Bombs and energy pulses shot forth in retaliation, arcs of light crisscrossing the void. The air crackled with energy harmonics as each explosion resonated with defiance against the malevolent force seeking to extinguish their light. Ukat felt the vibration thrumming in his core, the struggle within him palpable—a heightened sensation that underscored the urgency of the cosmic conflict.

Amidst the tumult, Ukat's focus honed in on a critical trajectory. Through the flashes of colour and the roar of battle, he spotted an enemy interceptor barreling toward the exposed fuel pods of an allied ship, oblivious to the calamity moments away. This reckless approach threatened not just the mission, but the very lives of those he was sworn to protect.

Instinct surged within him, flooding his systems with urgency. Ukat propelled himself forward, racing through space, driven by an unyielding desire to act.

Amidst the pandemonium, Ukat's attention narrowed to a crucial threat—a hostile interceptor closing in on the vulnerable fuel pods of an allied ship. Time seemed to freeze as he registered the imminent disaster.

Fueled by instinct, Ukat propelled himself toward the enemy vessel. “Back off!” he shouted as he unleashed his weapons with fierce determination. A slit bomb rocketed through the darkness, striking the interceptor just before it could reach its target. The explosion lit up the area, scattering debris like stars across the night.

As the battle raged on, Ukat felt the stakes rising. Every pulse of energy became a bold declaration of Rescueland’s ideals—to safeguard, to rescue, to vanquish the darkness threatening the innocent.

But in the midst of the combat, a foreboding sensation crept into Ukat’s core. A warning from Peuta jolted him from the heat of battle. “We’ve got more incoming! Something else is approaching!” 

A chill coursed through Ukat as the gravity of their situation set in. Reinforcements were on the way, but the new arrivals promised to be even more formidable than they had anticipated. The struggle loomed ahead, threatening to eclipse any hope of peace and delivering a challenge unlike any they had ever faced...
