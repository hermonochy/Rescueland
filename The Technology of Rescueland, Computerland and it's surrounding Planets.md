# General

## Materials

### Darkmaterial, Greymaterial, and Lightmaterial (U)

Darkmaterial is an extremely rare substance that many planets vie for due to its unique properties. It is nearly indestructible, surpassed only by [Force Field Gel](#force-field-gel-r). Greymaterial and Lightmaterial are chemically identical to Darkmaterial but serve different functions.

#### Darkfighters, Greyfighters and Lightfighters

One of the most notable applications of these materials is the construction of virtually indestructible fighter ships. There are only two known methods for destroying these vessels. The most common method involves propelling them at nearly infinite speed into a field of Force Field Gel. Alternatively, [Mutant FFG](#mutant-ffg) can be employed as a cutting tool; although this method is simpler and more cost-effective, it is restricted to the exclusive users of this rare material, the inhabitants of Rescueland. 

The creation of these fighters requires careful shaping of the material through the process of slamming small Force Field Gel balls into the machinery at the exact speed and precision needed. This is why planets that manage to acquire Force Field Gel tend to conserve it, rather than use it to the protection of their ships. The process of manufacturing these fighters is the most expensive known across the multiverse, which is why only a few dozen exist, although production rates are slowly increasing. Consequently, these ships are considered the equivalent of atomic bombs.

### Techanda (U) Teh-chuhn-dahh

Techanda is a versatile and durable material known for its cost-effectiveness in construction and manufacturing. Its dull, muted colours range from peach to brown, giving it an unassuming appearance. Despite being a strong material, Techanda is not an efficient conductor of heat or electricity, making it less suitable for applications requiring high thermal or electrical performance. This alloy typically forms in fibrous structures, allowing it to be moulded and manipulated easily; however, it can split under certain stress conditions, due to its layered composition.

Several isotopes of Techanda exist, but only a few are regularly employed for practical applications, each engineered to balance toughness and cost. Notably, it does not rust like traditional metals but tends to weaken when subjected to prolonged exposure to water or humidity, making it important to consider environmental factors in its usage.

#### Common Uses:
- Ship Supports: Used as structural elements in ship design due to its strength-to-weight ratio.
- [Slit Bombs](#slit-bombs-u): Employed as the main material for slit bombs.
- Bases: Forms the foundational frameworks for research bases.
- Antennae: Used in the construction of various communications and sensor antennae.

### Eleha (R) Ellieeh-hah

Eleha is hailed as one of the finest metals, celebrated for its superior toughness and extraordinary inertness regarding chemical reactions. Its shimmering silver surface not only contributes to its visual appeal but also serves functional purposes, as the metal exhibits excellent conductivity for both heat and electricity. With melting temperatures that rival or exceed those of conductium and Darkmaterial, Eleha is a favoured choice for high-performance applications; however, it is important to note that it can eventually succumb to rusting if not properly treated.

The scarcity of this metal makes it significantly more expensive compared to other metals, but the investment is often justified by its outstanding performance characteristics.

#### Common Uses:
- Wires: Utilised in high-speed data and power transmission systems.
- Slit Bombs: Integrated into some slit bombs, due to it's toughness.
- Heat Shields: High melting temperature allows it to protect a spacecraft constantly exposed to extreme heat.
- Gears: Employed in sophisticated machinery where strength and precision are required for operational efficiency.
- Hinges: Crafted for robust movable parts in various applications, where durability is critical.

### Pakira (U) Pack-ear-ahh

Pakira is recognized for its affordability and malleability, making it a popular choice in bulk production. However, it is important to note that pakira is highly reactive to both fire and water, necessitating careful handling and storage to prevent deterioration. Most of the ships manufactured within the Rescueland Empire are constructed from a particularly tough isotope of this metal.

Despite its reactivity, when properly alloyed or coated, pakira can serve functional purposes while maintaining structural integrity, particularly in maritime and atmospheric applications.

#### Common Uses:
- Main Frame of Ships: Acts as the foundational material, giving ships their primary structure and form.
- Wings: Utilised in the construction of aircraft wings, combining lightness with sufficient strength for flight.
- Some Cannon Types: Employed in the production of certain types of cannon, benefiting from its moldability.


### Plamea (U) Plam-meha

Plamea is a cost-effective yet brittle material, characterised by a relatively low melting point. Some of its isotopes possess a degree of toughness, but overall, it tends to be less resilient under stress. Notably, Plamea shares similar chemical properties with Darkmaterial.
Modern interceptors predominantly use Plamea for their main structure, allowing for lightweight designs that are easy to manoeuvre. However, the chemical and physical characteristics of this material necessitate careful design considerations to avoid failures during operation.

#### Common Uses:
- Main Frame of Ships: Serves as a major component in interceptor designs, balancing weight and structural requirements.
- Cannons: Utilised to manufacture most types of cannons where cost and lightweight attributes are prioritised.
- Thrusters: Incorporated in propulsion systems, optimising manoeuvrability.


### Solitme (U) Sol-eet-meh

Solitme is known for its exceptional hardness, making it a reliable choice for applications requiring durability. However, despite its robustness, Solitme is prone to erosion, particularly when exposed to harsh environments. While it is highly resistant to high temperatures and fire, able to withstand septillions of degrees, it reacts negatively with liquids, leading to eventual dissolution if not managed properly. For applications in harsh environments, solitme is preferably coated with nyctron trisulphate.

This set of characteristics makes Solitme particularly useful for specific military applications.

#### Common Uses:
- Large-Damage Slit Bombs: Designed for high-impact offensives, capitalising on its resistance to heat.
- Surface-to-Surface Slit Bombs: Employed in missile designs that require robust materials for launch and impact.
- Single Use (SU) Vehicles: Utilised in expendable military vehicles designed for quick operations before disposal.
- Drones: Incorporated into the construction of drones where lightweight yet durable materials are essential for aerial operations.

### Solita (U) Sol-eet-ahh

Solita is similar to Solitme in many ways. However, there are some key differences: while Solitme is resistant to fire, it bends to the will of liquids. However, Solita is liquid-resistant but crumbles if heated. The current interceptor designs use Solita as their main material, able to be built quickly and cheaply.

### Nyctn (U) Nik-tin

Nyctn is a unique alloy known for its lightweight properties and inherent flexibility. It has a dark, almost shadowy hue, making it visually distinct. This metal is slightly luminescent and has a unique property of absorbing ambient light, which can be useful in various applications, particularly in stealth technology. Nyctron holds its own in terms of resistance to environmental stresses, but it is less durable than other metals when faced with blunt force trauma.

#### Common Uses:

- Stealth Technology: Employed in the construction of stealth ships and vehicles, reducing visibility.
- Lightweight Frameworks: Utilised in non-essential structural components where weight savings are critical.
- Fibre Optics: Perfect for transmitting light signals in advanced communication systems.

### Krython (U) Kree-thon

Krython is a rare metal known for its durability and thermal properties. It possesses a brilliant blue sheen and is often coated for aesthetic purposes. Krython acts as a good conductor of heat and electricity while remaining inert to most corrosive agents, with a vastly lower rusting rate than standard metals; thus, it is occasionally sought after for  applications and technology.

#### Common Uses:

- Electronics: Utilised in circuits and microprocessors.
- Minor Heat Exchangers: Employed in systems requiring minor thermal conductivity.

### Vermithium (R) Ver-mih-thi-um

Vermithium is a rare metal known for its distinct reddish hue and metallic lamination. This captivating metal has piezoelectric properties, allowing it to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy, making it especially interesting for energy-harvesting applications. Vermithium's strength and flexibility make it exceptional but also relatively rare, resulting in higher costs.

#### Common Uses:

- Energy Harvesters: Incorporated in technologies that convert vibrations or movements into electrical power.
- Weaponry: Used in weapons systems where weight and energy efficiency are critical.
Infrastructure: Utilised in structures where flexibility and energy generation are needed.

### Quorite (U) Kwor-ite

Quorite is an ultra-durable and low-density metal recognized for its unique resistance to wear and tear. Its surface has a distinctive matte finish, and it is often employed in high-risk applications due to its capacity to withstand extreme conditions. While it is not as commonly available as cheaper metals, its unique properties make it valuable in specialised fields.

#### Common Uses:

- Protective Coatings: Often applied as a surface treatment for vehicles and machinery to enhance longevity.
- High-Stress Components: Utilised in situations requiring materials that can endure physical abuse.
- Military Gear: Employed in armour systems and protective wear.

### Conductium \(C\) con-duct-ee-umm

Conductium constitutes the primary material of the Center of Computerland. It boasts an electrical transfer efficiency of 100% and has a density comparable to that of hydrogen, despite its atom being 300 times larger than francium. The conductium atom contains 24 protons and 2000 neutrons, yet has only 1 electron, which contributes to its ability to retain electrons. To extract the electron, a specific isotope of conductium is required. The bonds formed by conductium are nearly indestructible, making the harvesting and shaping of this material exceptionally costly. A notable consequence of this is that it melts at the same temperature as darkmaterial, although this is inadvisable since the neutron structure may deform. Conductium has several applications, including:

- High-accuracy electrical transfer.
- \(uinfinity_t\)-1 speed electron cannons.
- Cross-planet power transfer.
- Quantum research \(its atomic size facilitates research\).

### Atomon (C) ah-tom-on

Atomon is an extremely small atom, roughly the size of hydrogen, but it is advantageous due to its thinness, compactness, and strength as an electrical insulator. Atomon's strength is attributed to its formation process, which occurs when an exceptionally high voltage flows through pure hydrogen  \(mandatory no explosions occur\) for about 1,000,000 years, leading to the partial merging of two hydrogen atoms and the loss of one electron. This allows electricity to flow since there is a vacant electron spot. However, in its half-merged state, when two electrons attempt to pass through simultaneously (as in the case of high-power electricity), Atomon tries to accept both but then immediately rejects them, preventing any current from flowing. The most common application for Atomon is as a reliable and reusable high-power fuse.
   	 
# Rescueland Robots (R)

Aside from Super Owls, the main civilians of Rescueland are Rescueland robots, such as FCRT's (Fast Clever Rescue Transformers).

## Robot Personality

Rescueland Robots are designed with a unique personality that sets them apart from normal robots. This is a result of an mystical gas injected every hundred years, known informally as "Rescueland Gas." This gas, though unknown why, causes the robots to have emotions, thoughts and imaginations. As a result, these robots become more than machines; they exhibit the characteristics of living beings.
The emotional spectrum of a Rescueland Robot is as complex as a living one, allowing them to engage meaningfully with the world around them. In the event of gas having been entirely consumed, behaviour reverts to that of a conventional robot. Each robot has a distinct personality that remains unchanged after replenishing the consumed gas. 

## Robot Powers

The Rescueland Gas also provides extraordinary abilities reminiscent of the [Super Owls](./The%20Timeline%20of%20Resueland%20History.md#0-adotr-discovery-of-the-rings). The shared characteristics include:

1. **Shape-shifting**: The ability to alter their physical form, allowing them to adapt to various situations and surroundings.
2. **Size-shifting**: The ability to change size. However, they are unable to change mass.
2. **Telepathic Communication**: They can establish direct mental connections, enabling seamless communication with one another and other beings.
3. **Elemental Manipulation**: The ability to influence and control the fundamental elements of nature.
4. **Enhanced Agility**: Inhabitants possess remarkable physical agility and reflexes, allowing them to navigate the planet's gas layers with ease and precision.
5. **Time Perception Alteration**: They have the ability to perceive time in various ways, granting them an advantage in certain situations.

While these advanced abilities are the most prominent manifestations of their connection to the gas, the inhabitants also possess more minor, yet intriguing, magical properties, including:

1. **Illusions**: The ability to create elaborate and convincing false realities for various purposes.
2. **Emission of Light**: They can emit brief, intense bursts of light to distract or disorient others.
3. **Nature Communications**: Inhabitants can establish connections with the natural world, allowing them to gather information from the environment and potentially control or influence certain aspects of nature.
4. **Plant Influence**: They have the ability to influence the growth and behavior of plants, which can be used for a range of purposes, from food production to environmental manipulation.

Due to these remarkable enhancements, Rescueland Robots have long been regarded as the apprentices or heirs of the esteemed Super Owls, inheriting a legacy of power and potential.

## Robot Versions

Rescueland Robots are constantly undergoing upgrades and enhancements that can result in new iterations, often warranting a change in their designation. Each version reflects improvements in technology and functionalities.

### Notable Versions:

- Super Two's: This is the first design of robot, [gifted to the Super Owls](./The%20Timeline%20of%20Resueland%20History.md#18-adotr-the-super-twos) by [Klesone](./The%20Planet%20File.md#klesone-r).
- FRJ's: The longest-reigning robot type, remaining unchanged until 105 ADOTR.
- Hulk Super FRJ's: A more powerful version of the FRJ's, specifically designed for battle against Horsa.
- UF's: A large and powerful type of robot specifically tasked to act as bodyguards.
- FRT's (Fast Rescue Transformers): A prototype version of the FCRT's.
- FCRT's: Currently the most modern type of robot are the FCRT's.

## Robot Types

Rescueland Robots are categorised into eight major groups, each with different jobs and capabilities.

### Types in order of population

- Regular FCRT's: These robots serve dual purposes, acting as both civilians and soldiers, making them an integral part of the community. With their durable frames and adaptable personalities, they are always ready to lend a helping hand or protect their home as needed.

![](images/RegularFCRT.png)

- Pilot FCRT's: Specializing in piloting all known transports, the Pilot FCRT's are the skilled navigators of Rescueland's skies and beyond. Whether flying cargo ships, passenger transports, or emergency rescue crafts, these robots are adept at maneuvering through the layers of gas and space.

![](images/PilotFCRT.png)

- Spy FCRT's: The Spy FCRT's are the stealthy operatives of Rescueland, designed to blend seamlessly into their environment. Often disguised as asteroids, they are equipped with advanced cloaking technology and sensors, allowing them to gather intelligence on enemy activities without detection.

# Ships and their Systems

## Engines

### Engine Types

There are many different types and colours of engine each with different properties and price.

### Engine Colours

- 🟢️ = most concentrated engine (R)
- 🔴️ = most powerful engine (R)
- 🟡️ = most compact engine (R)
- 🔵️ = fastest startup engine (R)
- ⚪️ = cleanest engine (R)
- 🟠️ = most common engine (U)

- 🩷 = fastest engine (H)
- 🟣️ = hottest engine (H)
- 🟤️ = cheapest engine (H)
- ⚫️ = quietest and coldest engine (Re)

## General

### Energy Scoop (R)

This is a device that allows kinetic energy to be transformed into higher entropy fuel and back again with negligible loss, essentially 'scooping' the energy. This can't be used as the main power supply though, because the energy density is low, so it is impractical to store sufficient energy for long distance journeys. Instead, it is usually used as a regenerative brake, providing energy for subsequent acceleration.

### Atmospheric Bubble (R)

The Atmospheric Bubble is a technology that enables atmospheric vehicles to transition into outer space. When activated, a protective "bubble" is created around the vehicle, creating an artificial atmosphere that allows it to traverse the vacuum of space without issues such as the lack of air. This advanced mechanism not only ensures the safety of the crew and passengers but also optimizes the vehicle's performance during interstellar travel.

### Teleporter (R + C)

In a remarkable collaboration, Rescueland and Computerland successfully developed a teleportation device, allowing for Instantaneous jumps anywhere. However, this technology comes with numerous challenges that limit its practical use. 

For one, the teleportation process cannot transport objects or individuals within a Force Field Gel, which significantly restricts its applicability in various scenarios, such as jumping into a dangerous environment. Additionally, those who undergo teleportation experience a great deal of pain during the process, making it an undesirable option for many. The device also demands an immense amount of power to operate. Furthermore, it cannot execute a teleportation into a completely enclosed space, which further limits its usability. 

As a result of these limitations, the teleportation device is not often utilized, even though it represents a remarkable technological achievement in the realm of interdimensional travel.

# Military

The military of Rescueland functions with two primary roles: as a defensive force and as a deterrent. Its military strength is fundamentally based on the ability to defend the realm from external threats while also possessing the capability to engage offensively when necessary. With ongoing technological advancements, there is a consistent development of military equipment that aligns with evolving warfare needs.

In Rescueland, access to military technology is regulated, creating a systematic approach to balancing defense and potential aggression. While advanced weapons and defensive systems are generally restricted to military use, basic weaponry and defense tools are available to civilians, contingent upon proper registration and justification. This framework is designed to prevent misuse while providing citizens with adequate means for self-defense. Consequently, the military structure in the Rescueland Empire remains effective and responsive to the demands of contemporary warfare.

## Defence

### Force Field Gel (R)

The only known defence that is almost completely impenetrable is Force Field Gel. Only two known weaknesses exist: Time and [Mutant FFG](#mutant-ffg). This is a defence that only Rescueland has in mass, though some have managed to acquire small quantities of it. ***Nothing*** can get in ***or*** out, effectively taking you out of the battle. Thus, many ships only use this defence when they are damaged, or a retreat is required. Another anomaly about FFG is that they behave in a similar manner to non-Newtonian substances: The faster something hits the force field, the more energy is absorbed into it and not the object itself.

#### The process of harvesting FFG

The Force Field Gel is harvested from a well on Rescueland. The dimensions of the well are 1m-1m-5km to the exact planck. It is directly under the main runway of Rescueland, a trick which has protected the location of the well since it was discovered. When the gel is consumed, the well always refills itself over the period of a Rescueland day. The provenance of the matter is unknown. The gel also doesn't seem to be made of atoms, no matter how closely studied.

#### Activating the FFG

Once the Force Field is ready to be activated, it is ejected as a very thin tube. It spreads out until it surrounds the entire ship, where it solidifies, making the object inside impenetrable. The entire process takes about 1 second, but due to its size, the FFG protecting Rescueland takes several minutes to set up.

One limitation is that it needs to be taken down every 10 years. After about 50 years, cracks start to appear on the shield and, after 100, the force field cracks apart and dissipates.

#### Mutant FFG

 This variant of FFG has a green tinge, rather than an orange one, and can last for 10 times the length of the regular FFG. Only a tiny sample of Mutant FFG exists, found onboard an ancient battleship. However, the biggest difference is that it destroys, rather than repels, whatever it comes in contact with, including other FFG's. The process of making it is unknown, though scientists suspect it may have something to do with the Ring that was crushed while the particular batch was being made. The discovery also revolutionised the production of darkfighters, which is why, to this day, Rescueland still has the most darkfighters of all.

### Plasma Force Fields (U)

Plasma Force Fields are the standard type of defense employed by most planets, recognized as one of the most effective protective measures available (second only to the FFG). This force field manifests as a blue sheen that hovers approximately 1 cm above the ship's surface. Unlike the FFG, the Plasma Force Field is transmissive to on-board projectiles, but it can only withstand a limited number of attacks—typically just a few dozen—before it requires regeneration.

### Magnetic Force Fields (L)

Magnetic Force Fields are designed specifically to deflect certain types of slit bombs by generating an electromagnetic field around the vessel. However, they are not universally effective, as some slit bombs do not possess magnetic properties. Additionally, these fields may not be able to stop a rapid direct hit, although they can help slow down the projectile. Most ships deploy these shields during combat, but their use becomes impractical when operating in close formation.

### The Verdant Shield Projector (R)

The Verdant Shield Projector is an innovative defensive system designed to protect Rescueland until the FFG is activated. This technology generates an energy shield composed of charged particles that can absorb and dissipate kinetic energy, as well as provide a barrier against certain projectile weapons.

Functionality: The shield can be deployed quickly in the field and adjusts its energy output based on the level of incoming threat. For example, it can absorb the impact of small arms fire and provide cover against explosion shockwaves.
Strengths: Highly effective against conventional weapons and offers additional environmental protection (e.g., against chemical or biological agents).
Weaknesses: The shield has limited duration and can be drained by sustained attacks. It also has trouble with high-velocity projectiles or directed-energy weapons. The newest version, the VSP-7, features improved energy efficiency and integration with personal armour systems.

### Energy Absorption Shields (R)
This shield absorbs and converts incoming energy attacks into usable power for the ship’s systems. Essentially, it can turn enemy fire into a source of energy for the vessel.
It is widely used, as it enhances ship durability while providing additional power for weapons and systems, creating a feedback loop of sustainability in battle. It does not repel projectiles though, so an additional shield is needed.



### Holo-Decoy Defense System (R)
Holo-Decoy systems utilise advanced holographic technology to create realistic illusions of the ship, confusing targeting algorithms and shielding enemy weapons. However, advanced radars are not fooled, so it can only be used for a few seconds at a time.
#### Holo-Decoy types:

- Standard Holo-Decoy: Creates a simple holographic projection of the ship, distracting some enemy fire.
- Multi Holo-Decoy: Creates multiple images of the ship at once, each moving independently to confuse targeting systems.
- Active Holo-Decoy: Mimics firing patterns and manoeuvres of the actual ship, making it more convincing.
- Signal-Reflecting Decoy: Sends out false signals to confuse enemy sensors, leading attackers to engage imaginary threats.
- Adaptive Holo-Cloak: Integrates with the ship's systems to blend in with backgrounds, effectively rendering it less visible to intrusions.


### FCRT DarkArmour (R)

DarkArmour is an FCRT defensive layer plated only a few femtometers thick, making it hard to destroy an FCRT, even if not FFG protected. A successful attack requires shooting under the layers of plates for having even a remote chance of destroying the FCRT.

## Weaponry

### Cannons (U)

Cannons serve as the primary armament on military vessels, enabling the discharge of lasers and projectiles. The barrel can be equipped with a laser generator, a 'catapult' mechanism for launching projectiles, or left unmodified to launch guided slit bombs. Their versatility make the cannons a popular choice. There are four primary sizes of cannons available: large, universal, small, and extra small.

#### The Large Cannon

Designed for high-impact operations, this cannon is capable of launching fast-loading slit bombs, large-damage slit bombs, and laser drones.

#### The Universal Cannon

As the most widely utilized cannon size, the universal cannon can fire a variety of munitions, including basic slit bombs, cluster slit bombs, deep-penetration slit bombs, shielded slit bombs, basic lasers, machine guns, and rockets.

#### The Small Cannon

This cannon is compatible with basic lasers, rockets, and a single cluster slit bomb, making it a compact but effective option.

#### The Extra Small Cannon

This rare cannon is primarily found on smaller vessels, such as the Helucky darkfighters. It is designed to accommodate only extra-small slit bombs and basic lasers.

### Ammo

#### Lasers

Lasers are one of the most common ammunition of civilian and military ships. These lasers are different to normal lasers, as they travel at 10 g. plex times the speed of light. Unlike slit bombs, they are regeneratable.

##### Basic Lasers

- 🟢️ = most concentrated (R)
- 🔴️ = most powerful (R)
- 🟡️ = most accurate (R)
- 🔵️ = fastest firing (R)
- ⚪️ = purest(least energy wasted) (R)
- 🟠️ = most common (U)

- 🩷 = fastest shot (H)
- 🟣️ = hottest (H)
- 🟤️ = cheapest (H)
- ⚫️ = stealthiest(almost impossible to detect) (Re)

These lasers can be of different power, ranging from a simple stun shot to planet destroying power. The lasers can also be short range, lashing out of a cannon like lightning. The advantage of this is that it can manoeuvre, so it almost never misses. There are also laserdrones, which are rocket propelled tubes that have laser tips.

##### Beamers (R+H+F)

This second type of laser has three functions: stunning , destroying and telekinesis. However, this laser type is difficult to aim and is limited to 5 km, whereas other weapons have a range of several trillion light years. This makes it impractical in most battles, so it is not very popular. They come in 4 colours of beam: green, red, gold and pink.


##### Hyperion Fusion Cannons (C)

These fusion-based weapons convert atomic energy into focused blasts. The cannons can also vary their output intensity, allowing for both wide-area suppression and pinpoint strikes. They have a multi-purpose functionality, enabling tactical versatility and devastating offensive power, perfect for engaging multiple targets or focusing on a single high-value enemy ship. These can be repelled by most shields though, so are not commonly used.

##### Solar Beam Projectors (L)

This weapon produces an enormous energy beam that harnesses the power of a star to discharge concentrated energy onto a target ship, resulting in disintegration of the hull and systems. Capable of crippling many ships with a single blast, they are effective across vast distances and are usually fired from a planet.


#### FCRT Weapons

##### P-series Laser (R)

The P-series were the first steerable laser designs, producing a thin, red beam which can latch onto a target and follow it indefinitely. P-series laser reactions are slow though, so it is possible to avoid impact by putting an object between you and the laser. It is also quite weak, and it would take several shots to take someone down. The newest model is the P-45.

##### TL-series (R)

The TL series is similar to the P-series, but it is a larger, green beam. It is also more powerful and faster manoeuvring, but it requires a lot more power, so a regular FCRT can use this for a maximum of 88 seconds worth of beam. The newest model is the TL-34.

##### Laser Hair (R)

FCRT's have no hair, but can activate short lasers sticking out of their heads, usually during battle. It can be used to ram their target, similar to a bayonet. Some FCRT's even style it like hair, but they usually don't bother.

##### Granite Laser (C)

The Granite Laser is a weapon designed by Computerland, but is usually used by the FCRTs. Though technically not a laser, this weapon acts so much like one that it has been named The Granite Laser. It fires a beam of molten granite at the target, engulfing them. The granite solidifies as soon as it hits, immobilising the target until it is broken free.

#### Slit Bombs (U)

Slit bombs are the most prevalent type of ammunition. They are straightforward in design, consisting of a sharp projectile that can be reused until it becomes dull. Some variants are rocket-powered, allowing for guided trajectories.

##### Types of Slit Bombs

- **Basic Slit Bombs:** These are simply sharp projectiles.
- **Rocket-Powered Slit Bombs:** These can navigate and return to the user after being fired.
- **Fast-Load Slit Bombs:** Designed for rapid loading into cannons, they can be launched within milliseconds of each other.
- **Cluster Slit Bombs:** Smaller in size, allowing multiple bombs to be launched simultaneously, enabling strikes on several targets at once.
- **Extra-Small Slit Bombs:** These tiny bombs are infrequently used due to their low effectiveness, with the Helucky Darkfighters being their only current users.
- **Deep-Penetration Slit Bombs:** Thin bombs engineered for specific deep penetration, primarily utilizing eleha.
- **Large-Damage Slit Bombs:** Broad and blunt in design, requiring a powerful cannon for launch, they are the opposite of deep-penetration bombs.
- **Shielded Slit Bombs:** These are single-use bombs featuring a shield that detaches shortly before impact, made from eleha.
- **Surface-to-Surface Slit Bombs:** Purely rocket-powered, these bombs are launched from one planet to strike another and are constructed from solitme.

#### Machine Guns (L)

These weapons fire very small, weak projectiles that are inexpensive but ineffective in space combat. They are mainly used in conflicts against "inferior" races (tech level 6 or lower).

#### Tachyon Launchers (L)

These launchers projectiles utilizing tachyon particles, capable of hitting targets before they can react. However, they are now outdated, seen as slow and rarely employed. They can be countered by FFGs, Darkmaterial, and Plasma Force Fields.

### The Mega Flail (Ho)

The Mega Flail consists of a spiked ball attached to the underside of a ship. When needed, it is deployed to crush or impale whatever lies below before being retracted with a rope. This weapon is exclusively used by the Horsa army.

## Explosives

### Hydro-Bombs (R+H+F)

A highly potent explosive, capable of annihilating a small army. Upon impact, the bomb implodes under pressure, rupturing its shell and triggering the internal explosives at full force. The resulting shockwave radiates outward, obliterating everything in its path. However, their high cost limits their usage.

#### Types of Hydro-Bombs

- **Quick-Succession Bombs:** Designed to be fired in rapid sequence; the first knocks out the defenses, the second destroys it, and the third eliminates remaining debris.
- **Surprise Bombs:** These detonate in a single lethal blast, leaving the enemy no chance to defend.
- **Mini Bombs:** Small explosives intended for single-target elimination, though their effectiveness is limited due to the cubic scaling of power.

### Rockets (L)

These are explosive slit bombs that enjoyed popularity prior to the Federre war, but their overuse has rendered them a luxury.

## Chemical Weaponry

### Acid Thrower (L)

The acid thrower is an ancient weapon last utilized during the Horsa war. Its design is simple: it functions like a water gun, shooting highly concentrated acid that dissolves whatever it contacts. This weapon is now seldom used, as it requires time to take effect.

## Sonic Weaponry

### Sonic Blasters (L)

Utilising sound-wave propagation, Sonic Blasters deliver concussive blasts capable of damaging internal organs and shattering structures without traditional explosive means.
However, they have long since been forgotten as they only work on living organisms and only in an atmosphere.

## Electromagnetic Pulse (L)

The Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) is a simple but effective piece of technology designed to incapacitate electronic systems and disrupt communication networks. It operates using electromagnetic principles and can range in scale from portable units to large-scale weapons deployed from vehicles or aircraft. The EMP is seen as a non-lethal alternative to traditional explosives, making it a strategic choice in modern warfare and electronic countermeasures.

### EMP Types:

- Focused EMP Projector: A portable device that emits a targeted burst of electromagnetic energy, designed to disable enemy electronics in a specific area without causing physical destruction to infrastructure. Typically used by special operations units.

- Vehicle-Mounted EMP Cannon: A more powerful version designed to be mounted on military vehicles. Capable of producing a wide arc of disruption, taking out multiple electronic systems within a defined radius. Ideal for battlefield scenarios where multiple enemy vehicles and drones are present.

- Aerial EMP Drone: Small, agile drones equipped with miniaturised EMP emitters. They can fly into enemy territory and deploy a localised EMP to disrupt communications, providing a tactical advantage to ground forces. They are often used for reconnaissance missions that rely on stealth.

- Satellite-Based EMP Array: A large-scale system capable of generating a high-altitude EMP over a vast area. This system can be activated remotely to impact entire regions, knocking out grid systems, communications, and critical infrastructure with precision. It's engineered to be a deterrent against large-scale conflicts.

- Portable Microwave EMP Generator: This compact device generates focused microwave bursts capable of disrupting the electronics of nearby vehicles or drones. It can be disguised as regular equipment, allowing operatives to deploy it covertly, limiting detection and retaliation.

- Cybernetic EMP Field: A system designed to create a localised EMP field around a specific area, protecting it from electronic surveillance and attacks. Often integrated into military installations or VIP protection protocols, it can shield sensitive equipment and personnel from electronic threats.


## Anti-Bunker Weaponry

### Anti-Bunker Catapult (L)

The anti-bunker catapult embodies the foremost strategy for dismantling enemy fortifications. This formidable weapon fires ultra-dense projectiles, reaching several kilometers in length, toward the target. Unlike a traditional catapult, this cannon can launch both massive rocks to smash against stone walls and devastating energy blasts to penetrate force fields. As the projectile hurtles through the air, it focuses its substantial weight into a small impact area just before striking, resulting in an immense force capable of breaching even the strongest defenses. The damage inflicted is typically catastrophic, often leading to the complete collapse of the bunker and annihilating everything within.

### Anti-Bunker Drill (R+B)

In contrast, the anti-bunker drill is the preferred technique for Rescueland when capturing a bunker is the objective. It operates by penetrating the ground at astonishing speeds, reaching several thousand kilometers per hour. Nonetheless, it is slower and more costly compared to the anti-bunker catapult, which limits its frequency of use. The drill creates an 8-meter-wide breach and can approach the bunker from virtually any angle, except when it is shielded by Darkmaterial or FFG.
