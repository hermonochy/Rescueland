## Defense
### Force Field Gel

The only known defense that is completely impregnable is the Force Field Gel.This is a defense that only Rescueland has, though many have attempted to get some. NOTHING can get in OR out, effectivly taking you out of the battle. Thus, many battleships only use this when they are damaged or a retreat is required. Another anomaly about them is that they behave like non-newtonian substances. The faster something hits the forcefield, the more energy is absorbed into the forcefield and not the object inside.

#### The process of harvesting FFG

It is harvested from a wellon Rescueland. The dimensions of the well are 1m-1m-5km to the exact planck. When the gel is taken, the well always refills itself over the period of a Rescueland day. There is no clear source. The gel also doesn't seem to be made of atoms, no matter how closley studied. 

#### Activating the FF

Once the Force Field is ready to be activated, it is ejected as a very thin tube. It spreads out until it surrounds the entire ship, where it solidifies and becomes solid, making the object inside impenetrable. The entire process takes about 1 second, but the FF protecting Rescueland takes several minutes to put up.

One limitation is that it needs to be taken down every 10 years. This is because one weakness of the FFG is time. After 50 years, cracks start to apear on the shield and, after 100, the forcefield cracks apart and dissipates.

### Plasma Force Fields

This is the kind of forcefield that all other planets use. It is the most effective of all defenses (except for the FFG) It creates a blue sheen 1cm above the surface of the ship. Unlike the FFG, you can shoot out while it is on, but it can only repel a few dozen shots before it needs to regenerate.

### FCRT DarkArmour

This is a defense that FCRT's carry. They have very thin plates of Darkmaterial (see below) on them, which is why it is hard to destroy an FCRT even without a FFG. The attacker is required to get under the layers of plates in order to land a shot thaat has even a remote chance of destroying the FCRT.


## Darkmaterial, Greymaterial and Lightmaterial

Darkmaterial is a very rare substance, fought for by many. Grey and Lightmaterial are chemicaly identical to Darkmaterial, but are used for different things.

### Darkfighters, Greyfighters and Lightfighters

The most famous use of this substance is to build practicaly undestructable fighters. The only known way to destroy these ships is to slam them at an almost infinite speed into a Force Field Gel. This is also how they are made. The material needs to be shaped into a fighter by slamming small Force Field Gel balls into the machine at the neccessary speed and precision. This is why the little Force Field Gel that other planets obtain is saved, should they find some Darkmaterial. The process is the most expensive one known in the entire multiverse, which is why there are only a few dozen of them, though they are increasing in number. Therefore, these ships are, in a way, the atomic bombs of the multiverse.


## Weaponry

### Guns

There are 4 main sizes of cannon:A large cannon, a universal cannon, a small cannon and an extra small one.

### Ammo

#### Lasers

Lasers are one of the most common ammunitions of civilian and military ships. Unlike slit bombs, they are regeneratable.

##### Basic Lasers

###### good lasers
- 🟢️ = most concentrated
- 🔴️ = most powerful
- 🟡️ = most accurate
- 🔵️ = fastest firing
- ⚪️ = purest(least energy wasted)
- 🟠️ = most common

###### bad lasers
- 💓️ = fastest shot
- 🟣️ = hottest
- 🟤️ = cheapest
- ⚫️ = stealthiest

These lasers can be of different power, ranging from a simple stun to planet destroying power. The lasers can also be short range, lashing out like lightning. The advantage of this is that it can manuver, so it almost never misses. There are also drones that have laser tips.

#### Beamers

The second type of laser has three functions: stunning electronics, destroying ships and telekinesis. However, this laser type is limited to 5 km, whereas other weapons have a range of several trillion light years. This makes it impractical in most battles, so it is not very popular. They come in 4 colours of beam: green, red, gold and pink.

#### Slit Bombs

Slit bombs are the most common type of ammo used. They are very basic, simply a sharp projectile, reusable until they go blunt. Some are rocket powered, so they are steerable.

##### Slit bomb types

- Basic slit bombs
- Rocket-powered slit bombs
- Cluster slit bombs
- Deep-penetration slit bombs
- Large-damage slit bombs
- Shielded slit bombs
- Surface to surface slit bombs

##### Machine Guns

These are increadibly small, weak projectiles, cheap but useless in space battle.

#### Explosives

##### Hydro-bombs

This is a very powerful weapon, capable of taking out a small army. They are very expensive however, so use is limited.

##### Rockets

These are simply explosive slit bombs.They were popular until the Federre war, but over-use has now made them a luxury.




## Engines

There are many different types and colours of engine each with different properties and price.

### Engine Colours
#### good

- 🟢️ = most concentrated engine
- 🔴️ = most powerful engine
- 🟡️ = most compact engine
- 🔵️ = fastest startup engine
- ⚪️ = cleanest engine
- 🟠️ = most common engine

#### bad

- 💓️ = fastest engine
- 🟣️ = hottest engine
- 🟤️ = cheapest engine
- ⚫️ = quietest engine
